## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ 

What got me hooked to computers and coding was the fact that if you tell a computer what to do (in the right way, of course!), it follows literally *every single instruction, meticulously*. Basically, you're having this incredibly fast and complicated machine waiting to take orders from you, ready to do whatever you want it to do. That to me is absolutely amazing, it's just so cool!

I was introduced to computers when I was around 10 years old. Here's how one looked like back then -

I loved games (especially *Road Rash!* :heart:) - I'd consider games to be a preliminary form of coding. Because playing a game strongly resembles the what happens when you code; you give input and the computer follows your intended command. I was hit by a curiosity to learn more about what happened behind the scenes (thank you, *abstraction!*) here - how we got this sophisticated machine to listen to a human in such a seamless fashion. I thus took great interest in my first ever programming classes, and managed to score a perfect 100% on the computer programming subject in my tenth standard board exams (yaaay!). 

After my twelth standard, it came to me naturally to choose Computer Science as my major for my Bachelors. I was able to get into National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, one of the top 20 institutes in the country and the oldest NIT. It was here that I learnt the fundamentals of Computer Science - so many interesting subjects that genuinely blew my mind. Data Structures is where you can literally use and build customized blocks of data *efficiently*, Databases teaches you about how you save and retrieve data *efficiently*, Operating Systems tells you about way your computer works hard to manage your applications and memory *efficiently* - hold on. It seems doing things *efficiently* is how the computer rolls! Turns out, all that *behind the scenes* exploration got me passionate about learning and applying more of this incredibly beautiful field. Recently, Machine Learning caught my attention - and I've been working on it deeply ever since.

I had the opportunity to intern at the Bengaluru office of the leading digital payments technology company, Visa. I worked on developing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications from scratch. Based on my work here, I was offered a full time role as a Software Engineer. I eventually graduated first class with distinction - among the top 5 students in my department (woohoo!). On my GitHub, dear fellow explorer, you'd find relics of my work during undergrad. Multiple academic and personal projects, hackathon ventures, competitive programming interests, and a bit of random interesting stuff. It's a work in progress, but I strive to document each and every one of my repos one day!

Thanks for the read, I'm always open for collaboration!
