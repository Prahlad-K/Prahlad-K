## Experience and Education: 
I have ~2 years of Software Engineering experience at Visa Inc., where I received multiple **Gold "Above and Beyond" awards** for demonstrating leadership principles and delivering on several Customer Relationship Management (CRM) requirements. I currently pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science at Columbia University in the City of New York, specializing in Natural Language Processing. I graduated in 2020 from NIT Warangal with a bachelor's degree in CS, completing my studies on full scholarship and achieving distinction. 

## Research and Projects: 
My society-centric projects on Machine Learning broadly cover its applications in finance and healthcare, including depression diagnosis and stock portfolio allocation. These endeavors led one of my first-authored papers to receive the **Best Paper Award** at the ACM Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS COMAD) 2021, and another to receive an acceptance for publication from Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal by Elsevier. My team's work was also published in Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal by Elsevier, achieving 25+ citations in 2 years. I also surveyed the effects of large language models in Speech Recognition as part of Columbia's Fundamentals of Speech Recognition.
