# Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub :)

## Who am I?
I am a Software Developer at Visa Inc., currently in the CRM space working with solutions offered by Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics 365. I graduated in 2020 from NIT Warangal with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering, first class with distinction. My skills include solving problems using C, C++, Java, Python, C# (.NET, basics), Apex. I can also develop web/console applications for desktop and mobile using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Flutter, Lightning (Salesforce). 

I have a special interest in topics related to Machine Learning, and worked on projects broadly covering its applications in finance and healthcare. With this, my research efforts led one of my first-authored papers to receive the Best Paper award at the ACM Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS COMAD) 2021, and the other to receive an acceptance for publication from Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal by Elsevier.

Going forward, I look to improve my expertise on CRM systems, contribute to open source, participate in hackathons, research more on interesting topics in machine learning, and hopefully be of impact by solving problems!

## Tell me more!
What got me hooked to computers and coding was the fact that if you tell a computer what to do (in the right way, of course!), it follows literally *every single instruction, meticulously*. Essentially, you're having this incredibly fast and complicated machine waiting to take orders from you, ready to do whatever you want it to do. That to me is absolutely amazing because it has the potential to become an enabler for better human lives.

I was introduced to computers when I was around 10 years old. Here's how one looked like back then - I think we had a Zenith monitor!

Computers initially caught my attention through video games - I loved them! I'd consider games to be a preliminary form of coding. Because playing a game strongly resembles what happens when you code; you give input and the computer follows your intended command. I was hit by curiosity to learn more about what happened behind the scenes here (ever so grateful to you, *abstraction!*) - how we got this sophisticated machine to listen to and understand a button I pressed in such a seamless fashion. I thus took great interest in my first ever programming classes, and managed to score a perfect 100% on the computer programming subject in high school (tenth standard) board exams!

After my twelth standard, it came to me naturally to choose Computer Science as the major for my Bachelors. I managed to get into the competitive CS department at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, one of the reputed institutes in the country and the oldest NIT. It was here that I learnt the fundamentals of Computer Science - so many interesting subjects that genuinely blew my mind. Data Structures is where you can literally use and build customized blocks of data *efficiently*, Databases teaches you about how you save and retrieve data *efficiently*, Operating Systems tells you about way your computer works hard to manage your applications and memory *efficiently*. Yes, doing things *efficiently* is how the computer rolls! Turns out, all that *behind the scenes* exploration got me passionate about learning more of this incredibly beautiful field, which is paradoxically, surprisingly rooted in simplicity and common sense. Recently, Machine Learning caught my attention - and I've been working on it closely ever since. 

I had the opportunity to intern at the Bengaluru office of the leading digital payments technology company, Visa. I worked on developing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications from scratch. Based on my work here, I was offered a full time role as a Software Engineer. I eventually graduated first class with distinction - among the top 5 students in my department. On my GitHub, dear fellow explorer, you'd find relics of my work during undergrad. Multiple academic and personal projects, hackathon ventures, competitive programming interests, and a few random interesting endeavors. It's a work in progress, but I strive to document each and every one of my repos one day!

Thank you for your time, I'm always open for collaboration!
