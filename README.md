# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub :)

## Who am I?
Actively looking for Summer 2023 Software Engineering/Quantitative Analysis/Machine Learning Internships.

Skills: 
1) Solving problems using C, C++, Java, Python, C#.NET, SQL, Apex. 
2) Developing multiple web/console applications for desktop and mobile using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Flutter, Django, Salesforce Lightning, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform. 
3) Engineering Federated Search using Azure Cognitive Search, Elastic, and Google Cloud Analytics. 
4) Managing data stored in MySQL, Oracle RDBMS, Microsoft SQL Server, and Azure Cosmos DB.
5) Following CI/CD, Agile, and version control methodologies using Jenkins, JIRA, and Git/BitBucket.

Experience and Education: 
I have ~2 years of Software Engineering experience at Visa Inc., where I received multiple awards for demonstrating leadership principles and delivering on several Customer Relationship Management (CRM) requirements. I currently pursue an MS in CS from Columbia University, specializing in Natural Language Processing. I graduated in 2020 from NIT Warangal with a bachelor's degree in CS, completing my studies on full scholarship and achieving distinction. 

Research and Projects: 
My society-centric projects on Machine Learning broadly cover its applications in finance and healthcare, including depression diagnosis and stock portfolio allocation. These endeavors led one of my first-authored papers to receive the Best Paper award at the ACM Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS COMAD) 2021, and another to receive an acceptance for publication from Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal by Elsevier.
